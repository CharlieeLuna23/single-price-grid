## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

How to add button "on-click" effects. It was not required but the button seemed pretty boring for me.


### Continued development

To continue practicing with grid-templates as I had a hard time figuring out the layout as all the previous projects I've worked with have been styled with flex.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://blog.stackfindover.com/button-click-effect-css/) - This helped me get ideas for the button "on-click" effect.
